# 01_Data_Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. It involves cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that can be fed into a machine learning model.

### Common Techniques:

-   **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing or removing missing data.
-   **Outlier Treatment**: Detecting and handling anomalous data points.
-   **Data Scaling**: Scaling features to be on a similar scale (e.g., Standardization, Normalization).
-   **Categorical Data Encoding**: Converting categorical features into numerical format (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
-   **Data Splitting**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
