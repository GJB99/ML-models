# 04_Data_Structures_And_Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental computer science concepts that are essential for writing efficient and optimized code.

### Key Data Structures:

-   **Arrays**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
-   **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
-   **Stacks**: A linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
-   **Queues**: A linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
-   **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
-   **Graphs**: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
-   **Hash Tables**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

### Common Algorithms:

-   **Searching**: Algorithms to find an item in a data structure (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search).
-   **Graph Traversal**: Algorithms to visit every node of a graph (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search).
-   **Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems.
