# 05_Sorting_Methods

Sorting is a fundamental algorithm that arranges elements of a list in a certain order.

### Common Sorting Algorithms:

-   **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
-   **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists.
-   **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
-   **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.
-   **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
-   **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
