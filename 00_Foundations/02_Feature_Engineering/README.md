# 02_Feature_Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create features that make machine learning algorithms work better. It is one of the most important aspects of building a good model.

### Common Techniques:

-   **Binning**: Converting continuous variables into categorical variables.
-   **Interaction Features**: Creating new features by combining existing ones.
-   **Polynomial Features**: Creating polynomial combinations of features.
-   **Feature Scaling**: This can also be considered a part of feature engineering.
