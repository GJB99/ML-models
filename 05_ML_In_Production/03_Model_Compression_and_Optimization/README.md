# 03_Model_Compression_and_Optimization

As deep learning models become larger and more complex, deploying them in resource-constrained environments (like mobile phones, IoT devices, or web browsers) becomes a significant challenge. Model compression and optimization techniques aim to make models smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient without a significant drop in performance.

### Key Techniques:

-   **Quantization**: This is the process of reducing the precision of the numbers used to represent a model's parameters (weights and biases). For example, converting 32-bit floating-point numbers to 8-bit integers. This can lead to a 4x reduction in model size and often results in faster inference due to more efficient integer arithmetic on many hardware platforms.

-   **Pruning**: This technique involves identifying and removing unnecessary or redundant parameters from a trained network.
    -   **Weight Pruning**: Individual weights that are close to zero are removed.
    -   **Structured Pruning**: Entire channels, filters, or even layers are removed, which can lead to more significant speedups on modern hardware.

-   **Knowledge Distillation**: A method where a large, complex "teacher" model is used to train a smaller, more compact "student" model. The student model learns to mimic the output (and sometimes the intermediate representations) of the teacher model, effectively transferring the "knowledge" into a more efficient form.

-   **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: While also a part of AutoML, NAS can be specifically used to find highly efficient model architectures that are optimized for specific hardware targets (e.g., a particular mobile GPU).
