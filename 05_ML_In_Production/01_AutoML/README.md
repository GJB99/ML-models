Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) aims to automate the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. The goal is to make machine learning more accessible to non-experts and to accelerate the development workflow for experts by automating repetitive tasks.

### What does AutoML automate?

AutoML systems can automate various stages of the machine learning pipeline:
-   **Data Preparation and Preprocessing**: Automating tasks like imputation, encoding, and scaling.
-   **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Automatically creating and selecting the most relevant features.
-   **Model Selection**: Choosing the best algorithm for a given task from a wide range of possibilities.
-   **Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO)**: Automatically tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to achieve the best performance.
-   **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: A subfield of AutoML focused on automatically designing the architecture of neural networks.

### How it works:

AutoML systems typically use a combination of techniques, including Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and reinforcement learning, to intelligently search the vast space of possible pipelines and find the one that performs best on a given dataset, all with minimal human intervention.
