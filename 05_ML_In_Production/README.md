Building a model is only one part of the machine learning lifecycle. This section covers the crucial, practical aspects of deploying, scaling, and maintaining machine learning systems in real-world environments.

### Topics Covered:

-   **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)**: Automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning.
-   **Federated Learning**: Training models on decentralized data sources while preserving privacy.
-   **Model Compression & Optimization**: Techniques to make models smaller, faster, and more efficient for deployment, especially on edge devices.
