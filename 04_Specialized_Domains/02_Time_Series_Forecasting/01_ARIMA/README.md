# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models provide sophisticated statistical methods for analyzing and forecasting time series data[28][29]. ARIMA integrates three components to handle various temporal patterns in sequential data[30].

### Component Analysis

**Autoregressive (AR)**: Uses past values of the time series to predict future values through regression relationships[28]. The AR component captures trends and patterns based on historical observations[30].

**Integrated (I)**: Applies differencing to achieve stationarity by removing trends and seasonality[28]. This step ensures the time series has constant mean and variance over time[30].

**Moving Average (MA)**: Models the relationship between observations and residual errors from past predictions[28]. The MA component helps capture short-term fluctuations and noise patterns[30].

### Model Configuration

ARIMA models use notation ARIMA(p,d,q) where[30]:
- **p**: Number of lag observations (AR order)
- **d**: Degree of differencing (I order)  
- **q**: Size of moving average window (MA order)

This flexible parameterization allows ARIMA to adapt to various time series characteristics, from simple trends to complex seasonal patterns[29].
