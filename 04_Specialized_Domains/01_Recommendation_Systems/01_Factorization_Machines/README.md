# Factorization Machines

Factorization Machines (FMs) are a generic approach that allows to mimic most factorization models by feature engineering. They are particularly useful for tasks with high-dimensional sparse data, such as recommendation systems. FMs can model interactions between features that are rarely or never observed in the training data.

## Relationship with Matrix Factorization

A core inspiration for FMs is **Matrix Factorization**, a key technique in recommender systems for collaborative filtering. Matrix factorization models work by decomposing a large user-item interaction matrix into two smaller, lower-dimensional matrices representing latent factors for users and items.

This technique became widely known during the Netflix prize challenge and significantly improves recommendation accuracy. The approach reduces dimensionality while preserving essential user-item relationships, making it particularly effective for sparse datasets common in recommendation scenarios. FMs generalize this by allowing for more features beyond just user and item IDs.
