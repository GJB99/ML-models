# 01_Introduction_to_LLMs

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that is designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on vast amounts of text data and learn the patterns, grammar, and facts within that data.

### Key Characteristics:

-   **Massive Scale**: LLMs are "large" in two ways: they are trained on enormous datasets (terabytes of text), and they have a huge number of parameters (from hundreds of millions to trillions).
-   **General-Purpose**: Unlike traditional NLP models designed for specific tasks (like sentiment analysis), LLMs are general-purpose. They can perform a wide range of tasks with little or no task-specific training.
-   **Emergent Abilities**: LLMs often exhibit "emergent abilities," which are capabilities that were not explicitly programmed into them but arise as a result of their scale and training. This includes things like few-shot learning, where the model can perform a task given only a few examples.

### How they are trained:

LLMs are typically pre-trained on a large corpus of text using self-supervised learning. The most common pre-training objective is "next-word prediction," where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence. After pre-training, they are often fine-tuned on smaller, more specific datasets to improve their performance on particular tasks or to align them with human preferences (e.g., through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback - RLHF).
