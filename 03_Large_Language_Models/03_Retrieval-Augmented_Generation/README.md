# 03_Retrieval-Augmented_Generation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of Large Language Models by grounding them with external knowledge. It combines a pre-trained generative model with a retriever that fetches relevant information from a knowledge source.

### Why RAG?

Standard LLMs are trained on a fixed dataset and have no access to real-time information. This leads to several problems:
-   **Hallucinations**: The model can generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information.
-   **Outdated Knowledge**: The model's knowledge is frozen at the time of its training.
-   **Lack of Transparency**: It's difficult to know where the model's information is coming from.

RAG helps to mitigate these issues by providing the model with relevant, up-to-date information at inference time.

### How it works:

1.  **Retrieval**: When a user provides a prompt, the system first uses a retriever module to search a knowledge base (like a collection of documents or a database) for information relevant to the prompt. This knowledge base is often indexed into a vector database for efficient searching.
2.  **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then appended to the original prompt, providing context for the language model.
3.  **Generation**: The augmented prompt is fed to the LLM, which then generates a response that is grounded in the provided context.

This process makes the model's output more accurate, verifiable, and up-to-date.
