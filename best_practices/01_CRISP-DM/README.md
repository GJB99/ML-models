# CRISP-DM Methodology

The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) provides a structured framework for conducting data science projects across industries and technologies[36][37]. Developed in 1996 as a European Union project, CRISP-DM represents the most widely-used analytics model[36].

### Six-Phase Lifecycle

CRISP-DM organizes data mining projects into six interconnected phases[37][38]:
1. **Business Understanding**: Defining project objectives and requirements
2. **Data Understanding**: Collecting and exploring available data sources
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis
4. **Modeling**: Selecting and applying appropriate algorithms
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and business value
6. **Deployment**: Implementing solutions in production environments

### Flexible Framework Benefits

The methodology's flexibility allows customization for specific organizational needs[37]. Projects can move back and forth between phases as necessary, accommodating iterative development approaches common in data science[37]. CRISP-DM's industry-agnostic design makes it applicable across diverse domains and technical environments[38].
