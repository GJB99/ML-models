# K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering represents one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms for data clustering, grouping unlabeled data points into K distinct clusters[10]. The algorithm iteratively minimizes the sum of distances between data points and their cluster centroids[10].

### Algorithm Mechanics

The K-means process involves several key steps[10][11]:
1. **Initialization**: Specify the number of clusters (K) and randomly assign data points to clusters
2. **Centroid Computation**: Calculate the centroid (mean) of each cluster
3. **Point Reassignment**: Reassign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid
4. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-3 until cluster assignments stabilize

The algorithm uses mathematical distance measures, typically Euclidean distance, to determine cluster membership[10]. The elbow method helps determine optimal K values by analyzing inertia (distance-based metric) across different cluster numbers[12].

### Applications and Considerations

K-means clustering finds extensive use in[10]:
- **Market Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior
- **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning images into meaningful regions
- **Document Clustering**: Organizing text documents by topic similarity

The algorithm's efficiency and simplicity make it particularly valuable for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing for other machine learning tasks[10].
