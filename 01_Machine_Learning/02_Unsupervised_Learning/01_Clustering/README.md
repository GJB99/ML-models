# 01_Clustering

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than to those in other groups.

### Common Clustering Algorithms:

-   **k-Means Clustering**: A method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters.
-   **Hierarchical Clustering**: An algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.
-   **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions.
