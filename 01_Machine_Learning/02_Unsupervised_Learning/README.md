# 02_Unsupervised_Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on unlabeled data. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any explicit labels.

### Common Techniques:

-   **Clustering**: The task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
    -   *Algorithms: k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN*
-   **Dimensionality Reduction**: The process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.
    -   *Algorithms: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE*
-   **Association Rule Learning**: A rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
    -   *Algorithm: Apriori*
