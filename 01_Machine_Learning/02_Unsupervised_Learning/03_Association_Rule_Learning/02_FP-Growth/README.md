# FP-Growth Algorithm

The FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm provides an efficient alternative to Apriori for mining frequent itemsets. It constructs a compact data structure called an FP-tree and extracts frequent itemsets directly from it.

This approach handles large datasets more efficiently than Apriori because it avoids the costly candidate generation step, discovering the same association rules with less computation[35].
