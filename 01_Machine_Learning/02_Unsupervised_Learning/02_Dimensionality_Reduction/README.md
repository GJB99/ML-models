# 02_Dimensionality_Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of input variables in a dataset. High-dimensional data can present various challenges, such as the "curse of dimensionality," increased computational cost, and model overfitting.

### Key Techniques:

-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A linear technique for dimensionality reduction that can be used to extract the most important features (principal components) from a dataset.
-   **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: A non-linear technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets.
