# Neural Oblivious Decision Trees (NODE)

NODE is a machine learning model that combines the strengths of decision trees and deep neural networks. It learns hierarchical, non-linear transformations of the input data, making it competitive with gradient boosting methods on tabular data while maintaining a degree of interpretability inherent in tree-based models.
