# LinearBoost

LinearBoost is a boosting algorithm that uses linear classifiers as its base learners, in contrast to traditional boosting methods like XGBoost or LightGBM which use decision trees. It has been shown to outperform tree-based boosting methods on several benchmark datasets while also offering significantly faster training times.
