## Algorithm Details

### Core Methodology
EBM uses **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** with modern boosting techniques:

```
y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£f‚ÇÅ(x‚ÇÅ) + Œ£f‚ÇÇ(x‚ÇÇ) + ... + Œ£f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º) + Œµ
```

Where:
- `f‚ÇÅ(x‚ÇÅ), f‚ÇÇ(x‚ÇÇ), ...` are univariate functions for individual features
- `f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º)` are bivariate functions for feature interactions
- Each function is learned through gradient boosting

### Training Process
1. **Feature Functions**: Learn individual feature contributions using boosting
2. **Interaction Detection**: Automatically identify important feature pairs
3. **Interaction Modeling**: Learn interaction effects between feature pairs
4. **Model Assembly**: Combine all components into final interpretable model

### Key Innovations
- **Cyclic Boosting**: Alternates between features to build interpretable functions
- **Automatic Interaction Detection**: Identifies important feature interactions
- **Shape Functions**: Non-linear relationships captured through smooth functions
- **Built-in Regularization**: Prevents overfitting while maintaining interpretability

## Detailed Mathematical Framework

### Generalized Additive Model (GAM) Foundation
EBM extends the classical GAM formulation:

```
g(E[Y|X]) = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø f·µ¢(x·µ¢) + Œ£·µ¢<‚±º f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º)
```

Where:
- g() is the link function (identity for regression, logit for classification)
- Œ≤‚ÇÄ is the intercept term
- f·µ¢(x·µ¢) are univariate shape functions for individual features
- f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º) are bivariate interaction functions

### Cyclic Boosting Algorithm
EBM uses a cyclic boosting approach to learn each function:

**For iteration t and feature j:**
```
f‚±º‚ÅΩ·µó‚Å∫¬π‚Åæ(x‚±º) = f‚±º‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ(x‚±º) + Œ∑ ¬∑ h‚±º‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ(x‚±º)
```

Where:
- Œ∑ is the learning rate
- h‚±º‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ(x‚±º) is the weak learner (typically regression trees)

**Residual Computation:**
```
r·µ¢‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ = y·µ¢ - (Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£‚Çñ‚â†‚±º f‚Çñ‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ(x·µ¢‚Çñ) + Œ£‚Çñ<‚Çó,{k,l}‚â†j f‚Çñ‚Çó‚ÅΩ·µó‚Åæ(x·µ¢‚Çñ, x·µ¢‚Çó))
```

### Shape Function Learning
Each univariate function f·µ¢(x·µ¢) is learned as a sum of regression trees:

```
f·µ¢(x·µ¢) = Œ£‚Çò‚Çå‚ÇÅ·¥π Œ≥·µ¢‚Çò ¬∑ ùüô[x·µ¢ ‚àà R·µ¢‚Çò]
```

Where:
- M is the number of boosting rounds
- Œ≥·µ¢‚Çò are the regression tree leaf values
- R·µ¢‚Çò are the regions defined by tree splits
- ùüô[¬∑] is the indicator function

### Interaction Detection and Scoring
EBM automatically detects interactions using FAST (Feature Addition and Statistical Testing):

**Interaction Score:**
```
Score(x·µ¢, x‚±º) = Œ£‚Çõ‚àà{bins} (n‚Çõ ¬∑ (»≥‚Çõ - »≥)¬≤) / Œ£‚Çõ n‚Çõ
```

Where:
- n‚Çõ is the number of samples in bin s
- »≥‚Çõ is the mean target value in bin s
- »≥ is the overall mean

**Statistical Test:**
```
œá¬≤ = 2 ¬∑ Œ£‚Çõ n‚Çõ ¬∑ log(»≥‚Çõ/»≥)
```

### Bivariate Interaction Functions
For selected feature pairs, EBM learns:

```
f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º) = Œ£‚Çò‚Çå‚ÇÅ·¥π Œ≥·µ¢‚±º‚Çò ¬∑ ùüô[(x·µ¢, x‚±º) ‚àà R·µ¢‚±º‚Çò]
```

Where R·µ¢‚±º‚Çò are 2D regions in the (x·µ¢, x‚±º) space.

### Link Functions
**For Regression (Identity Link):**
```
E[Y|X] = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£·µ¢ f·µ¢(x·µ¢) + Œ£·µ¢<‚±º f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º)
```

**For Binary Classification (Logit Link):**
```
log(P(Y=1|X)/(1-P(Y=1|X))) = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£·µ¢ f·µ¢(x·µ¢) + Œ£·µ¢<‚±º f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º)
```

**Probability Conversion:**
```
P(Y=1|X) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£·µ¢ f·µ¢(x·µ¢) + Œ£·µ¢<‚±º f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º))))
```

### Loss Functions
**For Regression (Mean Squared Error):**
```
L = (1/n) Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø (y·µ¢ - ≈∑·µ¢)¬≤
```

**For Classification (Logistic Loss):**
```
L = -(1/n) Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø [y·µ¢ log(pÃÇ·µ¢) + (1-y·µ¢) log(1-pÃÇ·µ¢)]
```

### Regularization and Smoothing
EBM applies regularization to prevent overfitting:

**L2 Regularization on Functions:**
```
R = Œª Œ£·µ¢ ‚à´ (f''·µ¢(x))¬≤ dx
```

**Smoothing via Binning:**
Functions are smoothed by binning continuous features:
```
f·µ¢(x) = Œ£‚Çñ‚Çå‚ÇÅ·¥∑ Œ≥·µ¢‚Çñ ¬∑ ùüô[x ‚àà bin‚Çñ]
```

### Feature Importance Calculation
EBM calculates feature importance as:

```
Importance(f·µ¢) = (1/n) Œ£‚±º‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø |f·µ¢(x·µ¢‚±º) - fÃÑ·µ¢|
```

Where fÃÑ·µ¢ is the mean effect of feature i.

### Prediction Process
**Single Prediction:**
```
≈∑ = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø f·µ¢(x·µ¢) + Œ£·µ¢<‚±º f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º)
```

**Local Explanation (Individual Prediction Breakdown):**
```
≈∑ = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Contribution‚ÇÅ + Contribution‚ÇÇ + ... + InteractionContributions
```

Where each contribution is interpretable and visualizable.

### Confidence Intervals
EBM provides uncertainty estimates using:

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:**
```
CI(f·µ¢(x)) = [fÃÇ·µ¢(x) ¬± t_{Œ±/2} ¬∑ SE(fÃÇ·µ¢(x))]
```

Where SE is the standard error estimated via bootstrapping.

### Optimization Objective
The complete optimization problem:

```
min Œ£·µ¢ L(y·µ¢, ≈∑·µ¢) + Œª‚ÇÅ Œ£‚±º ||f‚±º||‚ÇÇ¬≤ + Œª‚ÇÇ Œ£‚±º<‚Çñ ||f‚±º‚Çñ||‚ÇÇ¬≤
```
