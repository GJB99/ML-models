# 03_Reinforcement_Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

### Key Concepts:

-   **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
-   **Environment**: The world through which the agent moves.
-   **Action**: A move made by the agent.
-   **State**: The agent's current situation.
-   **Reward**: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken.
-   **Policy**: The strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state.
-   **Value Function**: Specifies what is good in the long run.
-   **Model (of the environment)**: Mimics the behavior of the environment.

### Common Algorithms:

-   **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy telling an agent what action to take under what circumstances.
-   **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: A combination of Q-Learning and deep neural networks.
-   **Policy Gradients**: A method to optimize the policy directly.
