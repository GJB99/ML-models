# Decision Trees

Decision trees provide intuitive, tree-like models that make predictions through series of binary decisions based on feature values[18]. They are used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Key Concepts:

-   **Root Node**: Represents the entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
-   **Splitting**: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
-   **Decision Node**: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, it is called a decision node.
-   **Leaf/Terminal Node**: Nodes that do not split are called Leaf or Terminal nodes.
-   **Pruning**: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. It is the opposite process of splitting.
-   **Information Gain & Gini Impurity**: Metrics used to decide how to split the nodes.
