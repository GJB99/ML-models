# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines represent sophisticated supervised learning algorithms that find optimal hyperplanes to separate data classes by maximizing margins between different classes[15][16]. Developed by Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues in the 1990s, SVMs excel in both classification and regression tasks[15].

### Core Principles

SVMs work by[15][16]:
- **Optimal Hyperplane**: Finding the decision boundary that maximizes the margin between closest data points of opposite classes
- **Support Vectors**: Using only the critical data points that define the optimal hyperplane
- **Kernel Trick**: Transforming non-linearly separable data into higher-dimensional spaces where linear separation becomes possible

### Advantages and Applications

Key strengths include[17]:
- **High-Dimensional Effectiveness**: Performs well even when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses only support vectors in the decision function
- **Versatility**: Supports different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) for various data characteristics

SVMs find applications in signal processing, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image recognition[16].
