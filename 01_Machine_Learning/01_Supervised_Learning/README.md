# 01_Supervised_Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen data.

### Common Algorithms:

-   **Linear Regression**
-   **Logistic Regression**
-   **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
-   **Decision Trees**
-   **Random Forest**
-   **Gradient Boosting Machines**
-   **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
