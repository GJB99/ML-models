# Naive Bayes Classification

Naive Bayes represents a family of probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with the strong independence assumption between features. Despite its simplicity and "naive" assumption, it often performs surprisingly well in real-world applications, especially in text classification and spam filtering.

## Mathematical Framework

### Bayes' Theorem Foundation

**Bayes' Theorem:**
```
P(class | features) = P(features | class) × P(class) / P(features)
```

**For Classification:**
```
P(y | x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) = P(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ | y) × P(y) / P(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)
```

### Naive Independence Assumption

**Strong Independence:**
```
P(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ | y) = P(x₁ | y) × P(x₂ | y) × ... × P(xₙ | y) = ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ P(xᵢ | y)
```

**Simplified Posterior:**
```
P(y | x₁, ..., xₙ) = P(y) ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ P(xᵢ | y) / P(x₁, ..., xₙ)
```

### Classification Decision Rule

**Maximum A Posteriori (MAP):**
```
ŷ = argmax_y P(y | x₁, ..., xₙ) = argmax_y P(y) ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ P(xᵢ | y)
```

Since P(x₁, ..., xₙ) is constant for all classes:
```
ŷ = argmax_y P(y) ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ P(xᵢ | y)
```

**Log-Space Computation (Numerical Stability):**
```
ŷ = argmax_y [log P(y) + Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ log P(xᵢ | y)]
```

### Prior Probability

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**
```
P(y = c) = N_c / N
```

Where:
- N_c is the number of training samples with class c
- N is the total number of training samples

**Laplace Smoothing (Add-one):**
```
P(y = c) = (N_c + α) / (N + α × K)
```

Where K is the number of classes and α is the smoothing parameter.

## Gaussian Naive Bayes

### Continuous Features

**Likelihood with Normal Distribution:**
```
P(xᵢ | y = c) = (1/√(2πσ²_ic)) × exp(-(xᵢ - μ_ic)² / (2σ²_ic))
```

**Parameter Estimation:**
```
μ_ic = (1/N_c) Σ_{j: y_j = c} x_{ji}
σ²_ic = (1/N_c) Σ_{j: y_j = c} (x_{ji} - μ_ic)²
```

**Unbiased Variance Estimator:**
```
σ²_ic = (1/(N_c - 1)) Σ_{j: y_j = c} (x_{ji} - μ_ic)²
```

**Class Prediction:**
```
ŷ = argmax_c [log P(y = c) + Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ log P(xᵢ | y = c)]
```

### Multivariate Gaussian

**Full Covariance (Rarely Used):**
```
P(x | y = c) = (1/√((2π)ᵈ|Σ_c|)) × exp(-½(x - μ_c)ᵀΣ_c⁻¹(x - μ_c))
```

**Diagonal Covariance (Standard Naive Bayes):**
```
P(x | y = c) = ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵈ (1/√(2πσ²_ic)) × exp(-(xᵢ - μ_ic)² / (2σ²_ic))
```

## Multinomial Naive Bayes

### Discrete/Count Features

**Multinomial Distribution:**
```
P(x | y = c) = (N! / ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵈ xᵢ!) × ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵈ θ_ic^xᵢ
```

Where:
- N = Σᵢ xᵢ (total count)
- θ_ic is the probability of feature i given class c

**Parameter Estimation:**
```
θ_ic = N_ic / N_c
```

Where:
- N_ic = Σ_{j: y_j = c} x_{ji} (total count of feature i in class c)
- N_c = Σᵢ₌₁ᵈ N_ic (total count of all features in class c)

**Laplace Smoothing:**
```
θ_ic = (N_ic + α) / (N_c + α × d)
```

**Simplified Likelihood (Dropping Constants):**
```
P(x | y = c) ∝ ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵈ θ_ic^xᵢ
```

**Log-Likelihood:**
```
log P(x | y = c) = Σᵢ₌₁ᵈ xᵢ log θ_ic + constant
```

## Bernoulli Naive Bayes

### Binary Features

**Bernoulli Distribution:**
```
P(xᵢ | y = c) = θ_ic^xᵢ × (1 - θ_ic)^(1-xᵢ)
```

Where xᵢ ∈ {0, 1}.

**Parameter Estimation:**
```
θ_ic = (Σ_{j: y_j = c} x_{ji} + α) / (N_c + 2α)
```

**Full Likelihood:**
```
P(x | y = c) = ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵈ [θ_ic^xᵢ × (1 - θ_ic)^(1-xᵢ)]
```

**Log-Likelihood:**
```
log P(x | y = c) = Σᵢ₌₁ᵈ [xᵢ log θ_ic + (1-xᵢ) log(1 - θ_ic)]
```

### Feature Presence vs Absence

**Accounting for All Features:**
Unlike multinomial, Bernoulli explicitly models absent features:
```
P(x | y = c) = ∏ᵢ: xᵢ=1 θ_ic × ∏ᵢ: xᵢ=0 (1 - θ_ic)
```

## Categorical Naive Bayes

### Nominal Features

**Categorical Distribution:**
For feature i with categories {1, 2, ..., k_i}:
```
P(xᵢ = v | y = c) = θ_icv
```

**Parameter Estimation:**
```
θ_icv = (N_icv + α) / (N_c + α × k_i)
```

Where N_icv is the count of feature i having value v in class c.

**Likelihood:**
```
P(x | y = c) = ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵈ θ_ic,xᵢ
```

## Smoothing Techniques

### Laplace Smoothing (Add-α)

**General Form:**
```
P(xᵢ = v | y = c) = (count(xᵢ = v, y = c) + α) / (count(y = c) + α × |V_i|)
```

**Common Choices:**
- α = 1 (Laplace/Add-one smoothing)
- α = 0.5 (Jeffreys prior)
- α = 1/|V_i| (Uniform prior)

### Lidstone Smoothing

**Generalized Additive Smoothing:**
```
P(xᵢ = v | y = c) = (count(xᵢ = v, y = c) + λ) / (count(y = c) + λ × |V_i|)
```

Where λ is estimated from validation data.

### Good-Turing Smoothing

**For Sparse Data:**
Redistributes probability mass from seen to unseen events based on frequency of frequencies.

## Probability Calibration

### Raw Scores to Probabilities

**Uncalibrated Scores:**
```
score(c) = log P(y = c) + Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ log P(xᵢ | y = c)
```

**Softmax Normalization:**
```
P(y = c | x) = exp(score(c)) / Σₖ exp(score(k))
```

### Isotonic Regression

**Calibration on Validation Set:**
Learn monotonic mapping from scores to calibrated probabilities.

### Platt Scaling

**Sigmoid Calibration:**
```
P_calibrated = 1 / (1 + exp(A × score + B))
```

## Feature Selection and Engineering

### Mutual Information

**Feature-Class Dependency:**
```
MI(X_i, Y) = Σₓ Σᵧ P(x, y) log(P(x, y) / (P(x)P(y)))
```

### Chi-Square Test

**Independence Testing:**
```
χ² = Σᵢ Σⱼ (O_ij - E_ij)² / E_ij
```

### Text-Specific Features

**TF-IDF Weighting:**
```
x_ij = tf_ij × log(N / df_i)
```

**N-gram Features:**
- Unigrams: individual words
- Bigrams: word pairs
- Character n-grams: subword features

## Computational Complexity

### Training Time
- **Parameter Estimation**: O(n × d) where n is samples, d is features
- **Smoothing**: O(d × K) where K is number of classes
- **Total**: O(n × d + d × K)

### Prediction Time
- **Per Sample**: O(d × K)
- **Batch Prediction**: O(m × d × K) for m samples

### Memory Complexity
- **Parameter Storage**: O(d × K) for categorical features
- **Gaussian**: O(d × K) for means and variances
- **Sparse Features**: Efficient with sparse matrices

## Handling Missing Values

### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

**Ignore Missing Features:**
```
P(x_observed | y = c) = ∏ᵢ∈observed P(xᵢ | y = c)
```

**Imputation:**
- Mode imputation for categorical
- Mean imputation for numerical

### Missing at Random (MAR)

**Model Missingness:**
Learn P(missing | observed, class) and incorporate into model.

## Multi-class Extensions

### One-vs-Rest (OvR)

**Binary Decomposition:**
Train K binary classifiers for K classes:
```
P(y = c | x) = P(y = c | x) / [P(y = c | x) + P(y ≠ c | x)]
```

### Native Multi-class

**Direct Extension:**
Naive Bayes naturally handles multiple classes:
```
ŷ = argmax_c P(y = c) ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ P(xᵢ | y = c)
```

## Model Evaluation

### Classification Metrics

**Accuracy:**
```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```

**Precision and Recall:**
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```

**F1-Score:**
```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

### Probabilistic Metrics

**Log-Likelihood:**
```
LL = Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ log P(yᵢ | xᵢ)
```

**Brier Score:**
```
BS = (1/n) Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ (P(yᵢ = 1 | xᵢ) - yᵢ)²
```

## Assumptions and Violations

### Independence Assumption

**When It Fails:**
- Correlated features (multicollinearity)
- Sequential dependencies (time series)
- Spatial correlations (image pixels)

**Robust Performance:**
Despite violations, often performs well due to:
- Parameter estimation robustness
- Decision boundary preservation
- Feature weighting effects

### Zero Frequency Problem

**Multiplication by Zero:**
Single zero probability causes entire product to be zero.

**Solution - Smoothing:**
Always use additive smoothing to avoid zero probabilities.
