# 02_Logistic_Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

### Key Concepts:

-   **Sigmoid Function**: The logistic function that outputs a probability between 0 and 1.
-   **Binary Classification**: Used for tasks with two classes.
-   **Multi-class Classification**: Can be extended for tasks with more than two classes (e.g., using Softmax).
-   **Cost Function**: Log Loss (or Cross-Entropy Loss).
