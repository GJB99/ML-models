Linear regression is a statistical method that is used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Key Concepts:

-   **Simple Linear Regression**: One independent variable.
-   **Multiple Linear Regression**: More than one independent variable.
-   **Cost Function**: Typically Mean Squared Error (MSE).
-   **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm to find the best fit line.
