# Random Forest

Random Forest extends the concept of decision trees by combining multiple decision trees through ensemble learning[18].

### Random Forest Enhancement

Random Forest addresses decision tree limitations through[18][19]:
- **Bootstrap Aggregation**: Training multiple trees on different random subsets of data
- **Feature Randomness**: Each tree uses different random subsets of features
- **Prediction Aggregation**: Combining predictions through voting (classification) or averaging (regression)

This ensemble approach significantly reduces overfitting and improves prediction accuracy compared to individual decision trees[18]. Random Forest handles both classification and regression problems effectively, making it one of the most versatile machine learning algorithms[19].
