# 01_Neural_Network_Fundamentals

This section covers the basic building blocks and concepts that form the foundation of all neural networks.

### Topics Covered:

-   **Perceptron**: The simplest form of a neural network.
-   **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: A neural network with one or more hidden layers.
-   **Feedforward and Backpropagation**: The processes of passing data through a network and updating its weights.
-   **Gradient Descent and Optimizers**: Algorithms used to minimize the loss function.
