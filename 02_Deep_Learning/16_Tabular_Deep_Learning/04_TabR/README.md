# TabR (Tabular Deep Learning with k-NN)

TabR is a deep learning model for tabular data that innovatively combines traditional feed-forward network components with a k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) component. This hybrid approach has shown significant progress in the field, even outperforming GBDT models on certain benchmarks.
