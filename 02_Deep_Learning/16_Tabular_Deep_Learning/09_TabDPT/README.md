## Mathematical Framework

### Tabular Data Representation
Given tabular data X ∈ ℝⁿˣᵈ where n is the number of samples and d is the feature dimension:

**Feature Preprocessing:**
```
X_processed = Embed(X_cat) ⊕ Normalize(X_num)
```

Where ⊕ denotes concatenation of categorical embeddings and normalized numerical features.

### Forward Diffusion Process (Noise Addition)
TabDPT defines a forward Markov chain that gradually adds Gaussian noise:

```
q(X_t | X_{t-1}) = N(X_t; √(1-β_t) X_{t-1}, β_t I)
```

Where:
- β_t ∈ (0,1) is the noise schedule at step t
- I is the identity matrix
- t ∈ {1, 2, ..., T} where T is the total diffusion steps

**Direct Sampling (Reparameterization):**
```
X_t = √(α̅_t) X_0 + √(1-α̅_t) ε
```

Where:
- α_t = 1 - β_t
- α̅_t = ∏ᵢ₌₁ᵗ αᵢ
- ε ~ N(0, I) is standard Gaussian noise

### Reverse Diffusion Process (Denoising)
The reverse process learns to denoise:

```
p_θ(X_{t-1} | X_t) = N(X_{t-1}; μ_θ(X_t, t), σ²_t I)
```

**Parameterization via Noise Prediction:**
```
μ_θ(X_t, t) = (1/√α_t)(X_t - (β_t/√(1-α̅_t))ε_θ(X_t, t))
```

Where ε_θ(X_t, t) is the learned noise prediction network.

### Transformer Architecture for Noise Prediction
The noise prediction network ε_θ uses a transformer architecture:

**Input Processing:**
```
H_0 = [X_t; Embed(t)] + PositionalEncoding
```

**Multi-Head Self-Attention:**
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
MultiHead(H) = Concat(head₁, ..., head_h)W_O
```

**Transformer Block:**
```
H' = LayerNorm(H + MultiHead(H))
H_out = LayerNorm(H' + FFN(H'))
```

### Time Embedding
Time step t is embedded using sinusoidal embeddings:

```
TimeEmb(t, 2i) = sin(t / 10000^(2i/d_model))
TimeEmb(t, 2i+1) = cos(t / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```

### Joint Training Objective
TabDPT optimizes both denoising and prediction tasks:

```
L_total = λ₁ L_diffusion + λ₂ L_prediction + λ₃ L_regularization
```

**Diffusion Loss (Denoising Objective):**
```
L_diffusion = E_t,X_0,ε [||ε - ε_θ(X_t, t)||²₂]
```

**Prediction Loss:**
```
L_prediction = E[ℓ(y, f_θ(X_0))]
```

Where ℓ is task-specific (cross-entropy for classification, MSE for regression).

**Regularization Terms:**
```
L_regularization = λ_weight ||θ||²₂ + λ_feature Σᵢ ||f_i||₁
```

### Noise Schedule Variants
**Linear Schedule:**
```
β_t = β_start + (β_end - β_start) · t/T
```

**Cosine Schedule:**
```
α̅_t = cos((t/T + s)/(1 + s) · π/2)²
```

**Learned Schedule:**
```
β_t = σ(MLP_schedule(t))
```

### Uncertainty Quantification
TabDPT provides uncertainty through the diffusion process:

**Epistemic Uncertainty:**
```
Var_epistemic[y] = Var[E[y|X_0, θ]]
```

**Aleatoric Uncertainty:**
```
Var_aleatoric[y] = E[Var[y|X_0, θ]]
```

**Total Uncertainty:**
```
Var_total[y] = Var_epistemic[y] + Var_aleatoric[y]
```

### Sampling Procedures
**DDPM Sampling (Full Steps):**
```
X_{t-1} = (1/√α_t)(X_t - (β_t/√(1-α̅_t))ε_θ(X_t, t)) + σ_t z
```

Where z ~ N(0, I) and σ_t = √β_t.

**DDIM Sampling (Deterministic):**
```
X_{t-1} = √α̅_{t-1} · pred_X_0 + √(1-α̅_{t-1}) · ε_θ(X_t, t)
```

Where:
```
pred_X_0 = (X_t - √(1-α̅_t) · ε_θ(X_t, t)) / √α̅_t
```

### Feature-Specific Diffusion
For mixed data types, TabDPT uses different diffusion schedules:

**Numerical Features:**
```
X_t^num = √α̅_t X_0^num + √(1-α̅_t) ε^num
```

**Categorical Features (via embeddings):**
```
E_t^cat = √α̅_t E_0^cat + √(1-α̅_t) ε^cat
```

### Conditional Generation
For conditional generation given partial features:

```
p_θ(X_missing | X_observed) = ∫ p_θ(X_missing, X_t | X_observed) dX_t
```

Implemented through classifier-free guidance:
```
ε_guided = ε_θ(X_t) + w · (ε_θ(X_t, c) - ε_θ(X_t))
```

Where c represents conditioning information and w is the guidance weight.

### Loss Weighting Strategy
Time-dependent loss weighting for stable training:

```
w(t) = (1 - α̅_t) / ((1 - α_t)²√α_t)
```

**Weighted Loss:**
```
L_weighted = E_t [w(t) · ||ε - ε_θ(X_t, t)||²₂]
```

### Prediction Head Architecture
The prediction function f_θ operates on clean data X_0:

```
f_θ(X_0) = W_pred · Transformer(X_0) + b_pred
```

Where the transformer processes the clean tabular data for prediction.

### Multi-Task Loss Balancing
Dynamic loss balancing for joint training:

```
λ_i(t) = exp(w_i(t)) / Σⱼ exp(w_j(t))
```

Where w_i(t) are learnable time-dependent weights.

### Inference Algorithm
**Complete Inference Process:**
1. Start with X_T ~ N(0, I)
2. For t = T, T-1, ..., 1:
   - Compute ε_θ(X_t, t)
   - Sample X_{t-1} using reverse process
3. Make prediction ŷ = f_θ(X_0)
4. Compute uncertainty estimates

### Gradient Flow Analysis
For stable training, TabDPT monitors gradient flow:

```
∇_θ L = E_t [∇_θ ||ε - ε_θ(X_t, t)||²₂]
```

With gradient clipping:
```
∇_θ ← ∇_θ / max(1, ||∇_θ||₂ / clip_norm)
```
