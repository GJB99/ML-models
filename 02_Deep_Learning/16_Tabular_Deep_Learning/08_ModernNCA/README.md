## Mathematical Framework

### Component Analysis Formulation
ModernNCA learns a set of components that capture meaningful patterns in tabular data:

**Input Processing:**
```
X = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ] ∈ ℝⁿˣᵈ
```

**Component Extraction:**
```
C = f_encoder(X) ∈ ℝⁿˣᵏ
```

Where k is the number of components and C represents the learned component matrix.

### Neural Component Learning
Each component cᵢ is learned through a neural network:

```
cᵢ = σ(Wᵢ · X + bᵢ)
```

Where:
- Wᵢ ∈ ℝᵈˣʰ are the component weights
- bᵢ ∈ ℝʰ are the component biases
- σ is the activation function (typically ReLU or GELU)
- h is the hidden dimension

### Component Matrix Construction
The full component matrix is constructed as:

```
C = [c₁, c₂, ..., cₖ]ᵀ = σ(W · X + b)
```

Where:
- W = [W₁; W₂; ...; Wₖ] ∈ ℝᵏˣᵈ
- b = [b₁; b₂; ...; bₖ] ∈ ℝᵏ

### Feature Reconstruction
ModernNCA reconstructs the original features to ensure meaningful components:

```
X̂ = f_decoder(C) = Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ αᵢ · cᵢ · Vᵢ + β
```

Where:
- αᵢ are learnable component importance weights
- Vᵢ ∈ ℝʰˣᵈ are reconstruction matrices
- β ∈ ℝᵈ is the reconstruction bias

### Reconstruction Loss
The reconstruction objective ensures components preserve important information:

```
L_recon = ||X - X̂||²_F = Σᵢ,ⱼ (Xᵢⱼ - X̂ᵢⱼ)²
```

### Task-Specific Prediction
From components, predictions are made:

**For Classification:**
```
ŷ = softmax(W_pred · C + b_pred)
```

**For Regression:**
```
ŷ = W_pred · C + b_pred
```

### Joint Optimization Objective
ModernNCA optimizes both prediction and reconstruction:

```
L_total = L_task + λ · L_recon + μ · L_reg
```

Where:
- L_task is the task-specific loss (cross-entropy/MSE)
- λ controls reconstruction importance
- μ controls regularization strength
- L_reg is the regularization term

### Component Importance Learning
ModernNCA learns component importance through attention:

```
αᵢ = softmax(wᵢᵀ · tanh(Wₐ · cᵢ + bₐ))
```

Where:
- wᵢ ∈ ℝʰ are attention weights
- Wₐ ∈ ℝʰˣʰ is the attention transformation matrix

### Adaptive Component Selection
The model adaptively selects the optimal number of components:

```
Component_score = ||∇L_task/∇cᵢ||₂
```

Components with low gradients can be pruned.

### Orthogonality Constraint
To ensure diverse components, ModernNCA enforces orthogonality:

```
L_ortho = ||CᵀC - I||²_F
```

Where I is the identity matrix.

### Information Bottleneck Principle
ModernNCA implements the information bottleneck:

```
L_IB = I(C; Y) - β · I(C; X)
```

Maximizing mutual information I(C; Y) while minimizing I(C; X).

### Component Variance Regularization
To prevent component collapse:

```
L_var = -Σᵢ log(Var(cᵢ) + ε)
```

### Complete Loss Function
The full optimization objective:

```
L = L_task + λ₁L_recon + λ₂L_ortho + λ₃L_var + λ₄L_IB + λ₅||θ||₂²
```

Where θ represents all model parameters.

### Forward Pass Algorithm
1. **Input Embedding**: X_emb = Embed(X)
2. **Component Extraction**: C = f_encoder(X_emb)
3. **Component Attention**: α = Attention(C)
4. **Weighted Components**: C_weighted = α ⊙ C
5. **Reconstruction**: X̂ = f_decoder(C_weighted)
6. **Prediction**: ŷ = f_predictor(C_weighted)

### Backward Pass (Gradient Computation)
```
∇L/∇W_encoder = ∇L/∇C · ∇C/∇W_encoder
∇L/∇W_decoder = ∇L/∇X̂ · ∇X̂/∇W_decoder
∇L/∇W_predictor = ∇L/∇ŷ · ∇ŷ/∇W_predictor
```

### Component Interpretation
Individual component contribution:

```
Contribution_i = αᵢ · ||cᵢ||₂ · cos(θᵢ)
```

Where θᵢ is the angle between cᵢ and the prediction direction.

### Dynamic Component Allocation
ModernNCA can dynamically adjust components:

```
k_optimal = argmin_k (L_task + penalty(k))
```

Where penalty(k) encourages component sparsity.
