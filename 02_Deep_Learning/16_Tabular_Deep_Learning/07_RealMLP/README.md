## Mathematical Framework

### Input Processing
Given input features **X** = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}, RealMLP processes them as:

**Numerical Features (after normalization):**
```
x_norm = (x - μ) / σ
```
Where μ and σ are feature mean and standard deviation.

**Categorical Features (embeddings):**
```
E_cat = Embedding(x_cat) ∈ ℝᵈ
```
Where d is the embedding dimension.

**Feature Concatenation:**
```
X_processed = Concat(x_norm₁, ..., x_norm_k, E_cat₁, ..., E_cat_m)
```

### Hidden Layer Computation
For layer l with input h^(l-1):

**Linear Transformation:**
```
z^(l) = h^(l-1) W^(l) + b^(l)
```

**Batch Normalization:**
```
z_norm^(l) = γ * (z^(l) - μ_batch) / √(σ²_batch + ε) + β
```

**Activation Function:**
```
a^(l) = f(z_norm^(l))
```

Where f can be:
- **ReLU**: f(x) = max(0, x)
- **GELU**: f(x) = x * Φ(x) where Φ is CDF of N(0,1)
- **Swish**: f(x) = x * sigmoid(x)

**Dropout Regularization:**
```
h^(l) = Dropout(a^(l), p)
```

### Residual Connections (Skip Connections)
For deeper networks, RealMLP uses residual connections:

```
h^(l) = h^(l-1) + F(h^(l-1))
```

Where F represents the transformation through the layer.

**Full Residual Block:**
```
h^(l) = h^(l-1) + Dropout(f(BatchNorm(h^(l-1)W^(l) + b^(l))))
```

### Adaptive Layer Width
RealMLP uses adaptive layer sizing with width progression:

```
width_l = width_0 * decay_factor^(l-1)
```

Where:
- width_0 is the initial layer width
- decay_factor ∈ (0.5, 1.0) controls width reduction

### Feature Interaction Modeling
Explicit feature interactions through:

**Pairwise Interactions:**
```
h_interaction = Σᵢ<ⱼ (hᵢ ⊙ hⱼ)Wᵢⱼ
```

Where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication.

**Higher-Order Interactions:**
```
h_poly = Σᵢ hᵢ² Wᵢᵢ + Σᵢ<ⱼ hᵢhⱼ Wᵢⱼ + Σᵢ<ⱼ<ₖ hᵢhⱼhₖ Wᵢⱼₖ
```

### Output Layer
**For Binary Classification:**
```
ŷ = sigmoid(h_final W_out + b_out)
```

**For Multi-class Classification:**
```
ŷ = softmax(h_final W_out + b_out)
```

**For Regression:**
```
ŷ = h_final W_out + b_out
```

### Loss Functions
**Binary Cross-Entropy:**
```
L = -∑ᵢ [yᵢ log(ŷᵢ) + (1-yᵢ) log(1-ŷᵢ)] + λ||θ||₂²
```

**Categorical Cross-Entropy:**
```
L = -∑ᵢ∑ⱼ yᵢⱼ log(ŷᵢⱼ) + λ||θ||₂²
```

**Mean Squared Error (Regression):**
```
L = ∑ᵢ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² + λ||θ||₂²
```

Where λ is the L2 regularization coefficient.

### Optimization
**Adam Optimizer Update Rules:**
```
mₜ = β₁mₜ₋₁ + (1-β₁)∇θₜ
vₜ = β₂vₜ₋₁ + (1-β₂)(∇θₜ)²
m̂ₜ = mₜ/(1-β₁ᵗ)
v̂ₜ = vₜ/(1-β₂ᵗ)
θₜ₊₁ = θₜ - η * m̂ₜ/(√v̂ₜ + ε)
```

### Learning Rate Scheduling
**Cosine Annealing:**
```
ηₜ = η_min + (η_max - η_min) * (1 + cos(πt/T))/2
```

**Step Decay:**
```
ηₜ = η₀ * γ^⌊t/step_size⌋
```

### Ensemble Prediction
For ensemble of K models:
```
ŷ_ensemble = (1/K) * Σₖ₌₁ᴷ ŷₖ
```

Or weighted averaging:
```
ŷ_ensemble = Σₖ₌₁ᴷ wₖ * ŷₖ
```
Where Σwₖ = 1.
