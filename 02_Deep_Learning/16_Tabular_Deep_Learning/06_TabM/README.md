## Mathematical Framework

### Feature Embedding
For a tabular dataset with features **X** = {x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ}, TabM first creates embeddings:

**Numerical Features:**
```
E_num(xᵢ) = W_num · xᵢ + b_num
```

**Categorical Features:**
```
E_cat(xⱼ) = Embedding_layer(xⱼ)  ∈ ℝᵈ
```

Where d is the embedding dimension.

### Position Encoding for Tabular Data
Unlike sequential data, TabM uses learnable position encodings for feature positions:

```
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
```

Combined feature representation:
```
H₀ = [E₁ + PE₁, E₂ + PE₂, ..., Eₙ + PEₙ]
```

### Multi-Head Self-Attention
The core attention mechanism for feature interactions:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

Where:
- **Q** = H·W_Q (Query matrix)
- **K** = H·W_K (Key matrix)  
- **V** = H·W_V (Value matrix)

**Multi-Head Attention:**
```
MultiHead(H) = Concat(head₁, head₂, ..., head_h)·W_O
```

Where:
```
headᵢ = Attention(HW_i^Q, HW_i^K, HW_i^V)
```

### Transformer Block
Each transformer block applies:

```
H'ₗ = LayerNorm(Hₗ + MultiHead(Hₗ))
Hₗ₊₁ = LayerNorm(H'ₗ + FFN(H'ₗ))
```

**Feed-Forward Network (FFN):**
```
FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

### Output Layer
For classification tasks:
```
ŷ = softmax(H_final · W_out + b_out)
```

For regression tasks:
```
ŷ = H_final · W_out + b_out
```

### Loss Function
**Classification:**
```
L = -∑ᵢ∑ⱼ yᵢⱼ log(ŷᵢⱼ) + λ||θ||₂²
```

**Regression:**
```
L = ∑ᵢ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² + λ||θ||₂²
```

Where λ is the regularization parameter.

### Attention Score Computation
TabM computes feature importance through attention weights:

```
α_ij = exp(score(hᵢ, hⱼ)) / ∑ₖ exp(score(hᵢ, hₖ))
```

Where:
```
score(hᵢ, hⱼ) = hᵢ^T W_a hⱼ / √d_k
```

### Feature Interaction Matrix
TabM learns a feature interaction matrix I where:

```
I[i,j] = ∑ₗ=1^L α_ij^(l)
```

This captures the cumulative attention between features i and j across all layers L.
